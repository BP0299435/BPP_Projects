League of Legends Data Analysis

2. Research Question / Business Problem
Research Question: Which League of Legends champions demonstrate consistently high performance (based on win rate, popularity, and KDA metrics), and which champions underperform or exhibit low pick rates, thereby indicating a need for game-balancing tweaks?

Business Problem: For eSports organizations, game publishers, and player communities, understanding champion performance is crucial. High-level analyses of champion statistics help guide decisions on balancing patches, player coaching strategies, and champion roster choices for competitive play. This project aims to illuminate which champions might need re-balancing or promotional efforts to encourage healthier gameplay diversity (Johnson and Kim, 2022).

3. Executive Summary (150–250 words)
This data science project investigates the performance metrics of League of Legends champions using publicly available Kaggle data. The overarching goal is to identify champions that consistently dominate in terms of win rate and popularity (“Preferred”) versus those that lag behind (“Avoided”). By merging two complementary datasets and conducting extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study examines various attributes such as health points, damage dealt, KDA ratio, and, crucially, composite scores derived from normalized performance indicators.

Key findings reveal that “Preferred” champions, like Ashe and Jarvan IV, generally maintain balanced but competitive profiles—moderate to high popularity coupled with stable win rates above 50%. Conversely, some “Avoided” champions, including Gangplank and Azir, exhibit lower win rates or steeper learning curves, suggesting they either require more specialized skill or suffer from unfavorable game-state balance. Visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps further highlight the correlations among champion attributes and underscore how certain champions thrive due to synergy among factors like high KDA kills, lower death rates, and higher popularity.

These insights can inform eSports professionals seeking draft advantages, as well as developers aiming to adjust game balance. Future iterations could incorporate time-series data spanning multiple patches, comparative analyses between casual and pro-level matches, or expansions to other beloved titles, including Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

4. Introduction / Project Background (150–250 words)
League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games, stands among the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) titles worldwide. With an extensive champion roster that continuously grows and evolves through regular patches, balancing remains a perpetual challenge (Smith, 2021). Balancing decisions can affect gameplay fairness and overall user satisfaction, as champions perceived as overpowered or underpowered may reduce engagement and competitive integrity (Chen and Huang, 2020).

Existing academic literature and industry reports suggest that data-driven approaches to champion balancing and game design are increasingly common (Wilson et al., 2019). By analyzing champion attributes—such as health, damage statistics, and resource mechanics—developers gain insights into whether certain champions underperform due to insufficient scaling or complex skill requirements. Meanwhile, players benefit from transparency around champion strengths, influencing pick-and-ban strategies during ranked or professional play.

In this project, I leverage my personal enthusiasm for League of Legends and my background in data analysis. The dataset, retrieved from Kaggle, comprises champion information including base stats, growth rates, in-game performance metrics (e.g., KDA, damage dealt), and popularity indicators. Merging these datasets provides a comprehensive view of champion performance, setting a foundation for potential balancing recommendations and further data-driven investigations into eSports analytics.

5. Data Source and Preparation (200–250 words)
Data for this project originated from the LOL Champions: Stats Overview on Kaggle, containing two CSV files:

export_lol_champs.csv – A file listing base stats such as health (HP), mana (MP), attack damage (AD), and defensive attributes (armor and magic resist).
lol_champions.csv – A more expansive set of champion attributes including gold earned, minions killed, wards placed, and advanced stats like ban rates, damage dealt, and KDA breakdowns.
Upon loading these datasets into pandas, I inspected their structures using methods like info() and describe(). Missing values were minimal, localized mostly in features like Style. These were handled by either dropping columns that provided no additional insight or by imputing with placeholders (e.g., “Unknown”) if the feature held potential strategic value. Duplicate rows were non-existent according to the .duplicated() check.

I then merged the datasets on the Champions column using an inner join, ensuring only matching entries carried forward. Care was taken to drop duplicate fields such as HP, AD, or MP from the second dataset to create a clean, consolidated DataFrame. Additional data cleaning steps involved transforming string-based columns (e.g., popularity percentages, gold numbers) into numeric form and normalizing certain statistics (win rate, popularity, KDA) to create an integrative “Composite_Score.” This measure facilitates champion comparison across multiple performance dimensions.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Initially, I conducted descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to understand how champion attributes relate to each other. Using seaborn’s heatmap, I discovered moderate positive correlations (r > 0.6) among certain pairs: champions with higher popularity often had moderate composite scores, but not necessarily the highest damage output—highlighting that popularity can be driven by community sentiment or ease of use (Smith, 2021). Health-related stats (HP, armor, magic resist) did not strongly correlate with KDA, suggesting mechanical complexity and synergy might outweigh raw defensive stats in determining success.

Feature Engineering
To systematically classify champions, I created a “Composite_Score” composed of normalized win rate (50% weighting), popularity (30%), and KDA ratio (20%). Champions whose scores surpassed the 75th percentile were labeled “Preferred,” while those beneath the 25th percentile were “Avoided.” This method provides a multi-criteria assessment reflective of both player sentiment (popularity) and raw performance (win rate, KDA).

Classification Findings

Preferred Champions: Ashe, Jarvan IV, Jhin, and Nami stood out with balanced stats and stable to high win rates. These champions appeal to a broad player base and typically remain relevant in various game patches (Chen and Huang, 2020).
Avoided Champions: Gangplank, Azir, and Gwen had lower composite scores due to sub-50% win rates or steep learning curves, despite some having substantial damage potential. Their complexity, or current meta disadvantages, places them on the underutilized end.
Statistical Observations
A follow-up group analysis indicated that “Preferred” champions averaged around 51.3% win rate, whereas “Avoided” champions hovered near 48.4%. Interestingly, “Avoided” champions sometimes dealt more damage on average, underscoring the idea that raw damage is not the sole determinant of success. The interplay between mechanical difficulty, synergy with teammates, and overall game meta seems integral.

7. Visualisations and Dashboards (250–300 words)
Heatmaps and Correlations
To illuminate relationships among variables, I generated a correlation heatmap focusing on absolute correlation coefficients exceeding 0.6. This heatmap, displayed in red-to-blue gradients, revealed minimal high-correlation pairs aside from slight mutual relationships among popularity, gold, and KDA—implying champion success can hinge on intangible or synergy-based factors not fully captured by single metrics.

Scatterplots
I produced scatterplots comparing the “Composite_Score” with champion win rates, coloring champion points based on “Preferred,” “Neutral,” or “Avoided” status. The distribution effectively showcased clusters of champions that consistently outperform or underperform. In some instances, I annotated the outliers (e.g., Gangplank or Azir) to highlight champions that might be strong in theory but have low success rates for the general player base (Wilson et al., 2019).

Bar Charts
Additional bar charts visualized average champion performance across groups. For instance, a bar plot of average win rate by “Preferred” vs. “Avoided” champions illustrated a clear gap, reinforcing the idea that champion performance is multifaceted but trackable via aggregated stats. Another bar chart of popularity scores provided an at-a-glance snapshot showing certain champions, like Yuumi, popular despite a polarizing set of opinions among the community—further emphasizing that “fun factor” or “ease of synergy” plays a role in pick rates.

Future Interactive Dashboards
Although this project primarily uses static visualizations, I envision an interactive dashboard, potentially built in Plotly or Power BI, that would allow gamers, coaches, and analysts to filter champions by role (e.g., mid-laner vs. support), patch number, or skill bracket. This would expand usability, enabling real-time patch impact analysis and champion pick-ban predictions.

8. Discussion / Recommendations for Future Iterations (100–150 words)
The classification approach uncovered a nuanced landscape: some “Avoided” champions remain potentially powerful but demand high mechanical skill or thrive only under specific team compositions (Johnson and Kim, 2022). Developers could address these champions through balancing adjustments or tutorials lowering skill barriers. Meanwhile, “Preferred” champions might risk overuse or stagnate the meta if left unchecked.

For broader insights, future iterations should incorporate patch histories, region-specific usage data, or professional tournament metrics. It would also be beneficial to examine synergy matrices (e.g., which champions excel when paired together) and time-series analyses capturing meta shifts. Additionally, expanding this approach to other favorite games, such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, would demonstrate the versatility of data analytics in gaming.
